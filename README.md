# Introduction
**ATF.Repository** - is an object-oriented data access technology. It is an object-relational mapping (ORM) solution for **bpm`online** from **Advanced Technologies Foundation**.

This is an external library and not a part of **bpm`online** kernel.

# General features:
- working with data via models;
- building direct and reverse data dependencies via models;
- creating, modifying and deleting data with the help of models with business logic implementation.

# Repository

**Repository** (*ATF.Repository.Repository*) - is a storage and model generator. All models should be created via the repository. All changes are applied via the repository. 

### Creating a repository instance:

```csharp
var repository = ClassFactory.Get<IRepository>();
repository.UserConnection = UserConnection;
```

### Saving changes:

```csharp
repository.Save();
```

## Model

**Model** - basic unit of data modeling. It is connected to the **Entity**.
The model is inherited from an abstract **BaseModel** class (*ATF.Repository.BaseModel*).
It is marked with the **Schema** attribute (*ATF.Repository.Attributes.Schema*).
Model properties, connected to the **Entity** fields, are marked with **SchemaProperty** attribute (*ATF.Repository.Attributes.SchemaProperty*).


**Attention!** The type of property must be the same as the type of data  in connected column.

**Note**. It is not required that the title of the model and its properties matches the title of the schema and its fields.

##### Example:

```csharp
[Schema("TsOrderExpense")]
public class Expense : BaseModel {

	// Connection with the "Type" lookup field
	[SchemaProperty("Type")]
	public Guid TypeId { get; set; }

	// Connection with the "ExpenseDate" Date-Time field 
	[SchemaProperty("ExpenseDate")]
	public DateTime ExpenseDate { get; set; }

	// Connection with the "Amount" decimal field 
	[SchemaProperty("Amount")]
	public decimal Amount { get; set; }

}
```

### Direct connection setup

To set up direct connection, add a property of a model type to the model and mark it with the **LookupProperty** attribute (*ATF.Repository.Attributes.LookupProperty*).

##### Example:

```csharp
[Schema("TsOrderExpense")]
public class Expense : BaseModel {

	// Connection with the "Order" lookup field
	[SchemaProperty("Order")]
	public Guid OrderId { get; set; }

	// Setting up direct connection with the Order model, using the value of "Order" lookup field
	[LookupProperty("Order")]
	public virtual Order Order { get; set; }

}

[Schema("TsOrder")]
public class Order : BaseModel {

	// Connection with the "Amount" Decimal field
	[SchemaProperty("Amount")]
	public decimal Amount { get; set; }

}
```

##### Example of using direct connection
```csharp
var amount = expenceBonus.Order.Amount;
```

### Reverse connection setup

To set up reverse connection, add a property of ```List<T>``` type to a master model, where "T" states for a detail model. Then add a Lookup property referring to the value by which the master model is determined.

##### Example:
```csharp
[Schema("TsOrderExpense")]
public class Expense : BaseModel {

	// Setting up reverse connection with the ExpenseProduct model, using the value of the "ExpenseId" property of the ExpenseProduct model
	[DetailProperty("ExpenseId")]
	public virtual List<ExpenseProduct> ExpenseProducts { get; set; }

}

[Schema("TsOrderExpenseProduct")]
public class ExpenseProduct : BaseModel {

	// Connection with the "Expense" Lookup field for reading data by reverse connections.
	[SchemaProperty("Expense")]
	public Guid ExpenseId { get; set; }

	// Connection with the "Amount" Decimal field
	[SchemaProperty("Amount")]
	public decimal Amount { get; set; }

}
```

##### Reverce connection use case

```csharp
var expenseProducts = expense.ExpenseProducts.Where(x => x.Amount > 100m);
```

##### Creating a new model instance
A model is created by calling a ```CreateItem<T>``` method and specifying the model type. Upon that, properties, connected to the Entity, will be populated with default values.

```csharp
var bonusModel = repository.CreateItem<Bonus>();
```

### Receiving the model by existing data from the repository
Existing model is read by means of calling a ```GetItem<T>``` method, where Id - is the identifier of the existing record.

```csharp
var bonusModel = Repository.GetItem<Bonus>(Id);
```

### Model data changing
```csharp
bonusModel.Amount = 100m;
```

### Deleting model instance from the repository
Model instance is deleted by calling ```DeleteItem<T>``` method, where  model - is the instance to be deleted.

```csharp
Repository.DeleteItem<Bonus>(model);
```

## Lazy loading

Models setup allows lazy loading of models by direct and indirect connections. To launch lazy loading add **virtual** modifier to the property. 

In the following example values of  **Order** and **Products** properties will be loaded at once. Values of **Document** and **Expenses** properties will be loaded at the moment of the first applying.

**Note**. If possible, lazy loading is recommended.

```csharp
[Schema("TsOrderExpense")]
public class Invoice : BaseModel {

	[LookupProperty("Document")]
	public virtual Document Document { get; set; }

	[LookupProperty("Order")]
	public Order Order { get; set; }

	[DetailProperty("InvoiceId")]
	public virtual List<Expense> Expenses { get; set; }

	[DetailProperty("InvoiceId")]
	public List<InvoiceProduct> Products { get; set; }

}
```

## Using basic mechanisms of data access

Working with models does not exclude usage of data access basic mechanisms - both via **EntitySchemaQuery** (*Terrasoft.Core.Entities.EntitySchemaQuery*) and **Select** (*Terrasoft.Core.DB.Select*).

These approaches are shown in the following example:

```csharp
[Schema("TsOrderExpense")]
public class Expense : BaseModel {

	public decimal BonusProductAmountSumm() {
		var select = new Select(UserConnection)
			.From("BonusProduct")
			.Column(Func.Sum("Amount"))
			.Where("Id").IsEqual(new QueryParameter(Id)) as Select;
		return select.ExecuteScalar<decimal>();
	}

	public decimal BonusProductPrimaryAmountSymm() {
		var esq = new 
EntitySchemaQuery(UserConnection.EntitySchemaManager, "BonusProduct");
		var primaryAmountColumnName = esq.AddColumn(esq.CreateAggregationFunction(AggregationTypeStrict.Sum, "PrimaryAmount"));
		var collection = esq.GetEntityCollection(UserConnection);
		return collection.Count > 0
			? collection[0].GetTypedColumnValue<decimal>(primaryAmountColumnName.Name)
			: 0m;
	}
}
```
